date: 2019-11-8 title: a nightmare of last night
>I got a nightmare last night,where I had a job and a rented room for life,and that was quite a unforgettable feel to recall.the details was lost before i awakened ,but I couldn’t help to repict the room I rented for a life as a  worker in the unfamiliar city.the room beneath the floor of a house, was such squeezed one with a bed,a table and other not much staffs of living,and the entrance ,was so narrow that I had to crawl throught it.bend my waist,curl my arms and legs,and jtst crawl.
If the rail began I should hurry to get back and put boards across the entrance to hold back the rainwater,otherwise a wet floor and entrance path would be my another tolerance after a day of the 996 work  schedule.
oh god,its really horrible,can you believe that was called a living?
